# Movies-ETL

# Purpose
The purpose of this is to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. We do this by using Python for extracting and cleaning, along with PostgreSQL to store our data. After taking in the raw data from multiple sources, we can confirm that the movies table has 6,052 rows and the ratings table has 26,024,289 rows.
